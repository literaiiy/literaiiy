### Hey!

Hello! I am literaiiy (styled lowercase), a high-school student in the San Francisco Bay Area. I enjoy working with technology a lot, especially smartphones and other mobile devices, older personal and data center computer components, and circuit board electronics. I also have years of experience in the Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Cloud suites.

literaiiy is a pseudonym I adopted in March of 2018 as an intentionally incorrectly spelt version of the word “literally.” It, being a word that has a simple definition and much use in everyday vocabulary, also is one that cannot be used correctly in a lot of cases- a common word that has dulled due to overuse.

My GitHub account is mostly used for hosting web development projects that I'm working on, for now. In the future I may un-private some of these repositories so you can see the internal spaghetti that holds together some of my websites!
