### Hey!

Hello! I'm Ethan, or literaiiy, a high-school student who develops web applications in his spare time.

literaiiy is a pseudonym I adopted in March of 2018 as an intentionally incorrectly spelt version of the word “literally.” It being a word that has a simple definition and much use in everyday vocabulary, also is one that cannot be used correctly in a lot of cases— a common word that has dulled due to overuse.

My GitHub account is mostly used for hosting web development projects that I'm working on, for now. In the future I may un-private some of these repositories so you can see the internal spaghetti that holds together some of my websites!
